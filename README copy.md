## Congratulations! 

You have been selected as a technician to repair our Customs Detector Software running on Python 3.8, known as CDS, 
a cutting-edge system deployed at the Martian border checkpoint. Please read the following instructions carefully.

As Mars becomes a popular interplanetary holiday destination, CDS plays a critical 
role in analyzing scanned items from adventurous Earth travelers to ensure a smooth and secure entry process.

As the first interplanetary holiday destination, Mars attracts a diverse group of holidaymakers from Earth. 
A few passengers opt not to carry their own towel in their hand luggage, so CDS needs to reject them immediately!

Your mission is to investigate and repair the software which started to malfunction around January 19th, 2038, when
a solar storm happened.

According to the law, holidaymakers are entitled to their own personal items as a benefit of not having enough legroom.
Scanned items from these adventurous passengers must be identified to determine if they are safe to warranty 
a wonderful time on Mars.

To help you identify which items are not allowed, [safe.txt](storage%2Fsafe.txt) 
and [dangerous.txt](storage%2Fdangerous.txt) are provided.
Please notice the special instruction "Any type of <item>" entries referring to multiple types.  

In case of an item that is neither on both lists, it must be consulted with the universe, and we should remember 
its decision for later (just in case changes its mind). 
But do not worry, that functionality is already implemented, and it has not been affected by the solar storm.

Your goal is to fix, refactor and simplify the existing python code, applying the practices you consider appropriate to 
warranty its correct behaviour. The code contains a couple of Disclaimer notes which should be taken into account.

Wish you best of luck on your mission!
